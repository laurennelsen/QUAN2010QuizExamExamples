  <title>Exam 1 Information</title>

  <p>
   Exam 1 will be available on Canvas to take during the days listed in the syllabus. 
  </p>


  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        The exam will cover Chapters 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7(Part 1) from the textbook, which are Chapters 2-7 in the course notes.  <url href="https://laurennelsen.github.io/QUAN2010/QUAN_2010_Notes.html"> Link to course notes </url>
      
      </p>
      
    </li>


    <li>
      <p>
        The exam will be broken into two parts, and you will have 60 minutes for each part of the exam.
      </p>
    </li>

<li>
  <p>
During both parts of the exam you may use your notes, the online course notes, the quiz/exam information site, a basic calculator (no phone) and a blank Excel file.  Some problems will require you to upload an Excel file with all your work/calculations in order to receive credit.
During quizzes you may NOT search the internet, use generative AI or use other resources that are not allowed.  </p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>
    You are NOT allowed to use other people's work or search internet sites while taking the test.  If you share you answers and others use them, both you and the students you shared with may receive a zero for the exam and may fail the course.
  </p>
</li>


<li>
  <p>
    Unless otherwise indicated, you must show steps/include all of your Excel calculations and formulas that demonstrate the process you take to get to the final answer.
  </p>

  <p>
  For problems involving probability distributions (such as the binomial or normal distribution), you need to use the Excel files to find any relevant values and not use values from a table.
  </p>

  <p>
    For problems that require showing work, credit will be given for not only the final answer, but the work/justification/formulas that supports that answer.

  </p>
</li>


<!--<li>
  <p>
    If you have a question during the exam, ask me!  It is much better to ask right away than to stay stuck for a long time.

    <title>Exam 1 Format</title>


    <p>
      The exam will be on Canvas, and it will be broken into two parts:  
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Part 1:  Must be done in the LockDown Browser
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Part 2:  Should NOT be done in the LockDown Browser
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      </p>


      <p>
      
      The exam may have some or all of the following problems/types of problems.  (The exam may have all of these types of problems or a subset of these types of problems.  Some of these problems might not have all the parts that were on corresponding quiz/homework problems.)  Examples of these problems (except for the multiple choice problems) are shown below under <xref ref="exercises-exam-1-practice"/>.

    </p>
    
    <p>
      For the multiple choice problems, I recommend looking back at conceptual homework assignments, reviewing concepts from the notes/the book and making sure you understand the definitions and topics we've talked about.

    <title>Suggestions for Study</title>

    <p>
      Look over all of your class notes and make sure you understand everything we have talked about.  Look back at these chapters/problems in the textbook.  Review the MyLab homework and the quiz problems.  (I do not guarantee that all exam questions will look exactly like one of those problems.) 

    </p>

    <p>
      Be able to do the problems under <xref ref="exercises-exam-1-practice"/>, and potentially include those on your <q>cheat sheet</q>.

<em>  Problem identifying mistake in a solution using Chebyshev’s Theorem:</em>
</p>
      <p>
        Assume the average selling price for houses in a certain county is <m>\$ 348,000</m> with a standard deviation of <m>\$ 30,000</m>.  Assume that the distribution of home selling prices is not bell-shaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      We want to find a range of prices that we expect to include at least <m>91\%</m> of the homes around the mean.  A student wanted to solve this problem and did the work below.  Identify the issue or mistake with this work/solution.
  </p>
<p>
  Student's solution:
</p>    
<p>
        <me>1-\frac{1}{z^2}=0.91</me>
        <me>1-0.91=\frac{1}{z^2}</me>
        <me>0.09 = \frac{1}{z^2}</me>
        <me>0.09z^2 = 1</me>
        <me>z^2=\frac{1}{0.09}</me>
        <me>z=\sqrt{\frac{1}{0.09}}</me>
    </p>
    <p>
        So the range of prices including values within <m>\sqrt{\frac{1}{0.09}}</m> of the mean will include at least <m>91\%</m> of the homes.
    </p>
    <p>
        <me>\mu\pm \sqrt{\frac{1}{0.09}}\sigma</me>
        <me>348,000\pm \sqrt{\frac{1}{0.09}}\cdot 30,000</me>

    <answer>
      <p>
        This solution is correct and does not have a mistake.  On the exam, you might have a version that is not correct and you will need to determine what the mistake is.  (This problem will be multiple choice.)
